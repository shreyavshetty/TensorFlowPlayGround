Tensorflow codes written as part of Advanced Machine Learning Course Work

### SimpleTensors.py

This code illustrates the use the symbolic constants and variables in tensorflow, 
interactive sessions which feed the data to the variables at runtime using two different approaches

### LinearRegressorEstimator
1. LinearRegressorEstimator.py
2. dataset.csv

A Linear Regressor is trained with a linear dataset using Tensorflow.
This code is mainly aimed to illustrates the use of:
- Dataset API
  - Provides an efficient input pipeline
  - Involves creating dataset instance from the data, creating an iterator and consuming data
- Pre-made Estimator
  - Provide a much higher conceptual level than the base TensorFlow APIs
  - Abstracts the creation of computational graph or sessions since Estimators handle all
